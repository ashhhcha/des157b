            <li>With an increase in temperature, there is more animal movement which means more interactions between species, leading to an increase in virus transmissions. This article dives in-depth about how these viruses arise, and directly impact humans. People need to be more cautious about more viruses spreading. With the emergence of new viruses, there is a possibility to wear masks in public again, and have more lockdowns based on the severity of symptoms because we don't have vaccines for them yet. It doesn't take much jumping from animal to animal for it to infect humans.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>As there is more flooding with climate change, architects need to start building homes and cities differently. There are six approaches to protection from a flood: attenuate, alleviate, restrict, create, realign, and embrace. To help people return to normalcy after a flood, raising the architecture can help flow the water out faster. Walkways may be raised into bridges to stay above higher water levels, creating a path for people to walk when there is flooding. The way we navigate a city, and use everyday appliances in our homes will have shifts.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>New sciences are dedicated to discovering different materials that will help people keep cool. People are wearing light clothing, like shorts and sandals, to prevent overheating. Ties may not be worn as often too. Cooling rocks embedded into the fabric for cooling effect. Prices of clothing will also increase as materials that are more cooling may be created with more expensive materials, like high quality cotton that is lighter and thinner. </li>
