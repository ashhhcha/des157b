    <title>Capstone Proposal</title>

    <h1>Proposal</h1>
    <p>My project addresses young adults and high school students about impeding consequences of the climate crisis. I am still thinking about the particulars of the project, and whether I should do it on fashion, architecture, or food. I will work on the project alone.</p>
    <p>The idea of my project will rely on challenging mental models to show the user they are vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. Some individuals detach themselves from the impacts, thinking they won’t be affected. However, everyone will be affected in the end.</p>
    <p>I plan to use data visualization to display changes from current to future lifestyle changes. This could come in the form of different clothing or other aspects including architecture, pandemics, and food.</p>
    <p>Some ideas for the project are a customizable wardrobe that will allow the user to select articles of clothing to create an outfit suiting the severe weather conditions we will face. Another is a more holistic approach in which the user has to scroll through the various consequences of the environment.</p>
    <p>My only current concern is I’m unsure about how to approach my ideas from a coding aspect.</p>
