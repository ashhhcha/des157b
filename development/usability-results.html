    <h1>Usability Results</h1>
    <img src="images/randytest.JPG" alt="user testing my project">

    <p>Three observations I noted with my participant:</p>
    
    <article id="usability">
        <h3>was hesitant where to go after second page</h3>
        <p>The instructions were a bit unclear at first, and he was clicking around to move the page.</p>


        <h3>wished the visual design was most stimulating</h3>
        <p>He wants to see more shapes that suggest the environment or landscape the user is in.</p>


        <h3>wasn't sure how far to scroll down</h3>
        <p>He was unsure how far down he had to keep scrolling and wished to see a visual indicator of how much more he has to keep going.</p>
    </article>

            In response to this feedback, I will create a notification at the side of the screen indicating to the user to scroll down whenever the page changes. I am also considering a small progress bar at the top of the screen to show the user how much of the page they've completed. I will also change the background of the last page to a desert landscape to help the user visualize the environment.
