            <p>This project has a strong narrative and storytelling. It guides the user through various future consequences of the climate crisis and predicts the different lifestyle changes we'll have to adapt to. It's a simple scroll down, yet does a good job in immersing the user into the storyline. The moving animated gifs also help bring in emphasis to the scene.</p>

            <p>I enjoy the interactivity in this project. There's an option to drag the Earth globe to a find specific locations you are interested in knowing predictions about. For a faster way to learn information, theres a tab to the left that lists the predications, which makes it convenient for those who aren't particularly interested locations.</p>
